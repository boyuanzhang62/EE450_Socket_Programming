In this assignment I've implemented the connection of different servers and clients. And implement 2 functions, write and compute. The program will write the information in a txt file named database.txt by using command write and compute the end to end delay by using command compute.


The client.cpp establish a TCP socket connected to AWS server. It will send the command to AWS server and receive result from AWS server.

The monitor.cpp establish a TCP connection to AWS server. It will receive the command and result from the AWS server.

The aws.cpp establish an AWS server. It will receive command from client using TCP and send it to monitor using TCP. It will also send to server A and server B using UDP, which depends on what the command is.

The serverA.cpp establish a server A. It will receive command from AWS server and write or search in the database, send the result to AWS server.

The serverB.cpp establish a server B. It will receive command from AWS server and compute the end to end delay, send the result to AWS server.


All messages exchange in char format and distinguish from each other with a space between 2 parameters.

Some basic codes come from Beej's Guide.
